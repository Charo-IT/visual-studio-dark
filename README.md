### Installation
Drop `Visual Studio Dark.tmTheme` file in: `\Data\Packages\Color Scheme - Default`

This is it.


This may also work with Textmate - I did not test it, because I am not using Texmate. But you may do the following:
Drop `Visual Studio Dark.tmTheme` file in: `~/Library/Application Suport/TextMate/Themes/`
